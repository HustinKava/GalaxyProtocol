      Attention beloved community! <br />
      We are currently undergoing a migration from SafeGalaxy to The Galaxy
      Protocol this will include an exchange of <b>SAFEGALAXY</b> tokens to the
      new <b>GALAXIA</b> tokens. The exchange of <b>SAFEGALAXY</b> tokens to{' '}
      <b>GALAXIA</b> tokens will take place between July 24th - 27th. You will
      have to <b>MANUALLY</b> take part in the migration. If you do not take
      part in the migration your SafeGalaxy investment value will be <b>LOST</b>
      . For more information please check out the <b>MIGRATION DOCUMENTATION</b>
      . <br />
      Thanks and much love &hearts;
