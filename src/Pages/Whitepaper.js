          'At GalaxyProtocol, we have asked ourselves if complete decentralization without trust is actually a viable solution for the long term. Hiding behind a wall of anonymity in a completely decentralized, trustless ecosystem causes inherent distrust and permits scammers and thieves to take advantage of those who would like to simply try to earn incredible returns as quickly as possible. The dark side of DeFi can be akin to thieves attacking poor travelers to steal their gold in the European Medieval Age.',

          'Our traditional, fiat banking system, although susceptible to corruption and mismanagement, evolved for a reason. In the west, after the collapse of Rome and prior to the Medici and the Knights Templar, moving funds from location to location was no simple manner and roads were often lawless and dangerous. If funds were being moved without physical protection they were susceptible to attack and theft. This period, between 500-1300 CE is commonly known as the Middle Ages. Modern historians conceptualize this time as sophisticated but the daily reality for the vast majority of people was very different. Roughly 80-90% of the population living in Western Europe during this time period were enslaved, serfs (almost but not quite enslaved) or peasants. Quality of life during the middle ages, by modern standards, was abject poverty.',

          'Demand for safe passage and currency exchange allowed various groups throughout the next few hundred years to serve as protectors for funds and goods that ensured safe transport of wealth, eventually evolving over the next millenia into our traditional retail banking systems. The Knights Templar, prior to their dissolution by Papal decree, were tasked, in part, with moving and securing Papal funds across Europe. After their dissolution, the Medici family of Florence, Italy became the dominant gatekeepers for moving and storing wealth for not just the Pope, but also for high ranking families across Europe. As financial services became available for those down the social hierarchy, more productivity and trade could take place. Goods and services could be provided more securely to more ordinary citizens with more entities available to secure the legitimacy and mobility of wealth. This, in turn, enabled the evolution of capitalism and the ability for more people to create more goods and services which would better the lives of all.',

          'This brings us to the late 20th century and the height of retail & central banking in the west. Certain legislation, enabled by western governments, permitted retail banks to create mortgage classes for those with lower credit scores allowing individuals to purchase homes. This in theory was in everyone’s best interest as the thought was that the housing industry, especially in the United States, could never collapse.',

          'It did collapse, due to the fact that those individuals, who had lower credit scores, could not actually pay off their mortgage. This in turn created a massive foreclosure on these homes. The supply outmatched the demand and the collateral assets were worth fractions of their previous worth. The banks, in the meantime, created bonds, or debt securities, where they could swap the ownership of these homes in exchange for excess cash for operations.',

          'This caused a massive problem. Since the banks had too great a supply of homes, due to the sharply increased foreclosure rate, and no income of cash for their other lending operations, many banks, most famously the Lehman Brothers, became insolvent and went bust. Unfortunately, the taxpayer was responsible for the cost of this massive blunder.',

          'So why was blockchain technology created? Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever they are, realized that they could solve the problem of double spend with Distributed Ledger Technology. Distributed Ledger Technology is a fancy phrase for a giant spreadsheet that anyone can see, provided they have access to the server or servers housing the data. The brilliance of blockchain technology is that any computer can become a host server and or access the data. With the use of encryption and Proof of Work algorithms, people could move data, or represented funds, across this network in a frictionless manner. This technology permits people to bypass the traditional banking system and send funds directly from peer to peer without having to go through a third party who may or may not act responsibly with their funds.',

          'In 2015, Ethereum came along and revolutionized Distributed Ledger Technology by allowing the blockchain network to become the host server for applications. What does this mean? The internet works via what web developers call, calls. The user interacts with an interface, the buttons that they click perform a task that is sent to a server, or calls the server, which performs the task and then returns the result to the user interface. This happens incredibly fast thanks to the creation of cloud computing.',

          'With the Ethereum Virtual Machine, we are now capable of having decentralized applications, where the blockchain itself acts as a giant, decentralized server.',

          '2017-2018 brought along what we now identify as the ICO bubble where many companies were creating tokens as a means for early seed funding. The regulators effectively banned ICOs/ITOs, comparing them to IPOs, in order to protect investors from scams.',

          'We now find ourselves in another bubble of pump and dumps, rug pulls and scams that will likely give regulators ammunition to clamp down on the DeFi ecosystem yet again.',

          'Every system, including DeFi, is susceptible to corruption, mismanagement and decay because the human race has the proclivity for greed, betrayal and narcissism as well as for good, benevolence and altruism.',

          'At GalaxyProtocol, we have asked ourselves if complete decentralization without trust is actually a viable solution for the long term. Hiding behind a wall of anonymity in a completely decentralized, trustless ecosystem causes inherent distrust and permits scammers and thieves to take advantage of those who would like to simply try to earn incredible returns as quickly as possible. The dark side of DeFi can be akin to thieves attacking poor travelers to steal their gold in the European Medieval Age.',

          'How are we trying to solve this fundamental problem in DeFi? The developers at GalaxyProtocol made the choice to break the wall of anonymity and go through the regulatory hoops in order to create more trust in this trustless ecosystem. We believe in accountability. We see our community as real people, not just wallet addresses. We believe that changing lives and making money together is better than making money on one’s own and certainly better than making money through deception. Everything that we do, we do with honesty and integrity. We own up to our mistakes and shortcomings by listening to our vocal and wonderful community. We would like to achieve greatness for as many people as possible, not just ourselves. Going forward, we will always stay true to our goal of building trust in this trustless ecosystem.',

          'As we grow, it is vital that our brand is easily recognizable while leaving room for us to exercise our creative capacity to its fullest. This allows us the freedom to expand and create under a more fluid framework. GalaxyProtocol is just that, an umbrella brand that can act as a "catch all" for everything we create, something that we and our community can expand on into the future.  GalaxyProtocol, as a brand of Cryptonite Technologies Ltd., will act as the home of our company profile, team members, future plans, and current info. We believe that through elevating our brand, current investors and newcomers alike will have the opportunity to learn and be inspired by the work we do. Simply, we need to move into a vehicle that can take us further. Through GalaxyProtocol, our wildest dreams will have have the framework needed to become a reality. ',

          'From the moment we announced GalaxySwap and Galaxia there have been concerns surrounding the future of SafeGalaxy. Such concerns include, but are not limited to, the price of SafeGalaxy falling due to the launch of a new token, confusion over which token is a better investment, and separation of focus between two projects. The executive team has been deliberating since the announcement (more than six weeks ago) over what is best for our business and our treasured community. We have come to the conclusion that there are two main routes, one of which stands in clear superiority over the other, allow us to explain.',

          'Our plan is to issue a dollar for dollar buy-back plus 20%. This means for every $1 you have of SafeGalaxy you get $1.20 of Galaxia. Galaxia will start at $1 on launch day. We will create a page on the GalaxyProtocol website where you can connect your wallet and exchange SafeGalaxy for Galaxia. Simple. Exchanging in this manner does not count as a "sell" and therefore will not incur a 10% transaction fee and will not affect the price of SafeGalaxy. The BuyBack page will go live 6 days before the launch of the swap and will close 3 days prior to launch. This will give the dev team sufficient time to make the necessary preparations for launch. After everyone has exchanged their SafeGalaxy for Galaxia, the Dev team will sell all of the collected SafeGalaxy in order to remove the BNB from the PancakeSwap liquidity pool (we can do this live on camera for anyone concerned about us taking off with the money). The Dev team will use 70% of this liquidity as initial liquidity on GalaxySwap and the other 30% as seed capital for future projects.  Believe us when we say that this plan did not come about without weeks of hard consideration from every member of our directors team. ',

          'We believe this plan is the superior method of transition for many reasons. First, it smoothly and effectively migrates the entire community onto the new token and new platform without any snag points or complex economics. This enables the community and dev team to focus all of their love, attention, and hype towards one project and one outcome. Second, it is impervious to exploits. The only way to get more Galaxia before launch is to buy more SafeGalaxy. Third, no 10% fees for exchanging. Only have to pay gas fee for one transaction. Fourth, it preserves investment value. $1000 in SafeGalaxy becomes $1150 in Galaxia. Fifth, it allows access to the locked liquidity on PancakeSwap by selling off exchanged SafeGalaxy. Sixth, because of the preservation of investment value and ability to access liquidity, we are able to move all of the value contained within SafeGalaxy to Galaxia. This effectively allows us to continue with Galaxia where we left off with SafeGalaxy. Seventh, we are able to preserve the majority of the market cap created by SafeGalaxy during this transition. Eighth, since a buyback allows us to move everything over so effectively, we are able to continue to market and promote SafeGalaxy as the "presale token" of Galaxia. This will likely create hype around SafeGalaxy and lead to an **increase in price.** An increase in the price of SafeGalaxy directly correlates to an increase in the initial circulating supply of Galaxia (this is a good thing) and also means we would have more liquidity for GalaxySwap (also a very good thing). Tenth, our marketing strategy becomes significantly easier both before and after launch. Marketing SafeGalaxy as a "presale token" is an easy pitch pre-launch. Post launch we simply market Galaxia and the swap. "Buy SafeGalaxy and wait for swap" = Super simple for new investors, this will lead to a much higher capture rate. Lastly, and most importantly, we are able to move away from the "safe" token name and into our own identity.',

          'We recognize that this is a bold move. SafeGalaxy has been an amazing first product for our company and our community. We have built a phenomenal team and network of colleagues and peers in the space: from marketers and advertisers to centralized exchange contacts, to Devs, and influencers. We have had many triumphs and learned some tough lessons all thanks to SafeGalaxy. It has been an incredible experience for us as young entrepreneurs. However, as business leaders, we often have to make incredibly tough decisions and this decision was not deliberated without giving it the respect it deserves. At the end of the day, we ultimately believe that the decision to migrate into Galaxia and away from SafeGalaxy will create long term success for our business and our community. Once we have collectively made it through this challenge, the path forward becomes much brighter. '

        paraContent: [
          `Arguably the most exciting thing we will release, GalaxySwap will become our central platform moving forward. With it we are free to build and expand to our hearts content. Many swaps on the BSC are designed and maintained by a group of anonymous developers. Rugpulls and scams are rampant, many have lost money. We understand the need for a safer option and that is what we plan to deliver with GalaxySwap. GalaxySwap's justification for existence is to build trust in a trustless ecosystem.`,

          'We understand the disappointment brought on by our failed initial launch, we were disheartened by it ourselves. We are, however, doing everything we can to make sure that the second launch is spectacular. This includes the rebranding, the buyback, and a marketing campaign that we are putting together, all of which will act as catalysts for hype surrounding the swap. But why the swap? Why is this beneficial to us as a business? '

If there isn't a trading pair for the tokens you wish to deposit it is possible to make one by depositing initial liquidity, the swap will auto generate a pair for you upon deposit. GalaxySwap's fee will be the lowest on the BSC at 0.2%. 5/6 of the trading fees are deposited into the liquidity pool and given to the liquidity providers. When you withdraw your liquidity the extra liquidity will be removed for you. 1/6 of the fees go to the Dev team as revenue.`

This is a fantastic incentive for investors to bring capital to our exchange. We can also offer farming pools to new projects that we are interested in partnering with. Doing so would help to stabilize the price of new projects and act as advertising for them. Yield farming is like staking taken to the next level, higher risk —> higher reward.`

          `Staking is similar to a traditional savings account. Deposit Galaxia into any staking pool and you will receive tokens in return. Different pools have different rewards. Some will give out Galaxia, others will give out tokens from partnered projects. We can offer staking pools to projects we are interested in partnering with. This will help to advertise the partnered project and allow our users access to new project tokens.`,

          `GalaxySwap rewards users with options. If a user wants to play it safe, they can provide liquidity to a stable coin pair and earn Galaxia. If they are all in on Galaxia, they can provide liquidity to the Galaxia liquidity pool and stake your earned Galaxia in the auto-compounding pool to earn Galaxia on their Galaxia. If one is looking to diversify, they can stake their Galaxia in one of the many staking pools to earn tokens from other verified projects. Possible future developments include: charts, limit orders, NFT marketplace, deflationary mechanics and multi-chaining. All of these ideas are still ideas, nothing is set in stone, these features have not been announced, and there is no guarantee that they will be implemented. Conversations on these features remain very high level at this time.`,

          `With inbuilt safety features and a sweet UI, GalaxySwap will become the home of innovation for GalaxyProtocol. It enables our company to move laterally and gives us the opportunity to unleash our ambitious, creative potential into space. This platform strives to achieve success for not just the devs but for all who join us on this exciting expedition. As always, making money on one's own is great, making money together is better. `
